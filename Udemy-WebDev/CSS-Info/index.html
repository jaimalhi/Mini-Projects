<!-- 
Even though we can add CSS content within HTML files it is better
to just have a seperate CSS file that we reference within the HTML
file for easier access and management 
-->

<!-- We would put this within the head block
<style>
    - Within this style block we can set all h1 headers to lightcoral 
    h1 {
        background-color: lightcoral
    } 
    - However it is smarter to just do this in a .css file
</style>
